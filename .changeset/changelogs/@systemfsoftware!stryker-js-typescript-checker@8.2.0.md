## 8.2.0

### Minor Changes

- The TypeScript checker now applies Trivial Compiler Equivalence (Papadakis et al., ICSE 2015). Each mutant of a file is emitted to JavaScript from the project's own TypeScript configuration in transpile-only mode, normalized, and compared with the original file's emit and with the mutants already emitted at the same site. A mutant whose emit equals the original's is dropped as `Ignored` with reason `equivalent-to-original: tce`; one that equals an earlier same-site mutant's is dropped with `duplicate-at-site: tce`; every mutant whose emit differs is kept, so the check never removes a mutant that changes the program. Checkers gain an `ignored` result variant carrying the suppression reason, and a run publishes the new `tce` machine-stream event with the `equivalentToOriginal` and `duplicateAtSite` counts. Verdict semantics move to version 3.
