## 13.0.1

### Patch Changes

- The packages now depend on `@systemfsoftware/effect-cell-types` 11.

  - Every tagged error now has a one-line message built from its fields, so a failure names the file, mutant, plugin, worker or exit code involved instead of an empty message. The errors' tags, fields and encoded forms are unchanged.
