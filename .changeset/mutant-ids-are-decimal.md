Mutant ids are decimal index strings. Every schema that carried a mutant id as a plain string now decodes `Mutant.MutantId` and refuses anything else: the mutation report and its mutant results, reporter events (`mutationTestingPlanReady` plans, `mutantTested`), the machine run stream (`mutant` and `verdict`), the survivors prior report, and the mutant coverage keys produced by test runners.

Mutant ids are minted only as the mutant's canonical non-negative decimal index (`Mutant.MutantId`), including in the instrumenter's planned mutants, placement sites, and checker answers. Consume the new `Mutant.MutantId` schema instead of assuming an arbitrary non-empty string; ids such as `constructor` or `__proto__` no longer decode.
